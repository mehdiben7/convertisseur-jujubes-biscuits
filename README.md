# Jujube-Candies-Cookies-Converter

## About

In primary school, my friend Jimmy and I used to trade jujube candies in exchange for small oreo-like cookies. The exchange rate was 1 cookie for 2 jujube candy. When I started learning C++ at the age of 12, I had an amazing idea. What if I made a script that could automatically convert jujube candy into cookies unit. It became a running joke for me to write little converter scripts for these trades in various programming languages.

## The exhaustive list of every languages I've written these scripts in

- C++
- Java (Using JOptionPane library)
- Bash
- HTML-CSS-JS

... and many more to come
